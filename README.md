# Chatbot Created with OpenAI and Deployed with Gradio
This chatbot was created using the OpenAI API, which utilizes cutting-edge natural language processing technology to enable the chatbot to understand and respond to user input. The large Languge model utilized here was the Chatgpt-3. The chatbot has been deployed using Gradio, a user-friendly platform for building and deploying machine learning applications. 

It should be noted that charges may apply per requests, please refer to [pricing](https://openai.com/pricing).
Although the advantages of using such application is that you do not get affected by the regular down-time or unavailability due to the many users. You can always access at anytime from anywhere and create personalised app use case as in this project.

# Instruction 
Firstly you need to create an account on [OpenAI](https://openai.com/), login and create an API key at [OpenAI generate secret key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

The same API key can be used accross all the files in the folder. In each of the .py files replace the api_key with the key generated.

In my case, due to my affinity for philosophy, I have customized the Chatbot in each file to be a different philosopher. You can change that according to your need or generalize the chat bot as an assistant. You can totally get creative.
